# Leetcode 1700: Number of Students Unable to Eat
> ### https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-students-unable-to-eat-lunch/description/
> 
>### Time Complexity: O(n)
> The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), we iterate through the student array and push the values to the queue.
> We iterate again this time through the student queue
> 
> ### Space Complexity: O(n)
> The space complexity is O(n) because we created a queue the size of the student array.
